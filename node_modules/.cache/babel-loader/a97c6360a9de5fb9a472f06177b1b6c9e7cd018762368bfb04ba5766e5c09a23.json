The main purpose of this project is to promote environmental protection, especially the theme of carbon cycle. We worked with students from the art school to complete this project. They designed a beautiful interface, and we implemented these designs into a fully functional website using the Vue framework. Through this collaboration, we not only ensured the visual appeal of the website, but also ensured the efficiency and stability of its technical implementation, providing a powerful platform for the promotion of environmental protection.\",\n      footerLink: [\n        {\n          name: \"Source code\",\n          url: \"https://github.com/XianxiangZHANG/Hyblab2023/tree/main/carbone\"\n        }\n        //  you can add extra buttons here.\n      ]\n    },\n  ],\n  display: true // Set false to hide this section, defaults to true\n};\n\n// Achievement Section\n// Include certificates, talks etc\n\nconst achievementSection = {\n  title: emoji(\"Achievements And Certifications üèÜ \"),\n  subtitle:\n    \"Achievements, Certifications, Award Letters and Some Cool Stuff that I have done !\",\n\n  achievementsCards: [\n    {\n      title: \"Google Code-In Finalist\",\n      subtitle:\n        \"First Pakistani to be selected as Google Code-in Finalist from 4000 students from 77 different countries.\",\n      image: require(\"./assets/images/codeInLogo.webp\"),\n      imageAlt: \"Google Code-In Logo\",\n      footerLink: [\n        {\n          name: \"Certification\",\n          url: \"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7kazrtMwm5dYkVvNjdNWjNybWJrbndFSHpNY2NFV1p4YmU0/view?usp=sharing\"\n        },\n        {\n          name: \"Award Letter\",\n          url: \"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7kazrtMwm5dekxBTW5hQkg2WXUyR3QzQmR0VERiLXlGRVdF/view?usp=sharing\"\n        },\n        {\n          name: \"Google Code-in Blog\",\n          url: \"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/01/google-code-in-2018-winners.html\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"Google Assistant Action\",\n      subtitle:\n        \"Developed a Google Assistant Action JavaScript Guru that is available on 2 Billion devices world wide.\",\n      image: require(\"./assets/images/googleAssistantLogo.webp\"),\n      imageAlt: \"Google Assistant Action Logo\",\n      footerLink: [\n        {\n          name: \"View Google Assistant Action\",\n          url: \"https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000100ee688ee?hl=en\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n\n    {\n      title: \"PWA Web App Developer\",\n      subtitle: \"Completed Certifcation from SMIT for PWA Web App Development\",\n      image: require(\"./assets/images/pwaLogo.webp\"),\n      imageAlt: \"PWA Logo\",\n      footerLink: [\n        { name: \"Certification\", url: \"\" },\n        {\n          name: \"Final Project\",\n          url: \"https://pakistan-olx-1.firebaseapp.com/\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  display: false // Set false to hide this section, defaults to true\n};\n\n// Blogs Section\n\nconst blogSection = {\n  title: \"Blogs\",\n  subtitle:\n    \"With Love for Developing cool stuff, I love to write and teach others what I have learnt.\",\n  displayMediumBlogs: \"true\", // Set true to display fetched medium blogs instead of hardcoded ones\n  blogs: [\n    {\n      url: \"https://blog.usejournal.com/create-a-google-assistant-action-and-win-a-google-t-shirt-and-cloud-credits-4a8d86d76eae\",\n      title: \"Win a Google Assistant Tshirt and $200 in Google Cloud Credits\",\n      description:\n        \"Do you want to win $200 and Google Assistant Tshirt by creating a Google Assistant Action in less then 30 min?\"\n    },\n    {\n      url: \"https://medium.com/@saadpasta/why-react-is-the-best-5a97563f423e\",\n      title: \"Why REACT is The Best?\",\n      description:\n        \"React is a JavaScript library for building User Interface.
